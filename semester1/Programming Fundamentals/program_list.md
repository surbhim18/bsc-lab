\*******  
9. Write a function that checks whether a given string is a Palindrome or not. Use this function

a) Print the even-valued elements.  
b) Print the odd-valued elements.  
c) Calculate and print the sum and average of the elements of user.  
d) Print the maximum and minimum elements of array.  
e) Remove the duplicates from the array.  
f) Print the array in reverse order.  
The program should present a menu to the user and ask for one of the options. The menu should also include options to re-enter and to quit the program.  
12. Create Matrix class. Write a menu driven program to perform following Matrix operations (2-D array implementation)  
a) Sum 
b) Difference 
c) Product 
d) Transpose  
13. WAP that prints a table indicating the number of occurences of each alphabet in the text
entered as command line arguments.  
14. WAP that swaps two numbers using pointers.  
15. Create a file that contains records of 5 employees. Each record contains an employeeâ€™s
salary details. Print the information retrieved from the filw in the following format:  
EId Name Basic HRA DA Extra Allowances  
16. Create a structure Student containing fields for Roll No., Name, Class, Year and Total
Marks. Create 10 students and store them in a file. Write a program to retreive the student
information from file created in previous question and print it in following format.
Roll No. Name Marks  
17. Copy the contents of one text file to another file, after removing all whitespaces.  
18. Create a class Triangle. Include overloded functions for calculating area. Overload
assignment operator and equality operator.  
19. To the above class Box add the following functions:  
a) Calculate Volume  
b) Overload + operator (to add two boxes length, breadth and height)  
c) Overload operator = = (to check equality of two boxes), as a friend function  
d) Overload Assignment operator  
e) Check if its a cube or cuboid  
20. Create a class Length containing feet and inch. Include following functions  
a) Input Length object  
b) Overload +operator (to add two lengths)  
c) Overload - operator (to subtract two lengths)  
d) Display Length object  
WAP which takes input from user for feet and inch to test the above class.  
21. Create a class Person. Create some objects of this class (by taking information from the
user). Inherit the class Person to create two classes Teacher and Student class. Maintain
respective information in the classes and create, display and delete objects of these two
classes. (Use Run Time Polymorphism).  
22. To the class Box (created in Q 19) add overloaded constructors to enable the creation of a
Box without passing any arguments, creation of a cube with a single argument, and a cuboid
with three arguments.  
23. To the class Box (created in Q 19) add a copy constructor that provides for initialising a Box
using another Box.  
24. Create a class Location with data members latitude and longitude. Overload operator + using
friend functions to enable incrementing the latitude and longitude by a given integer. Demonstrate that ob+100 and 100+ob are both valid.  
25. In the above class Location , implement the prefix and postfix versions of increment and
decrement operators.
